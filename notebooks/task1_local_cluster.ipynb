      "\"63\" \"HAN\" \"Why not?\"\n",
      "\"64\" \"THREEPIO\" \"Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia.  Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.\"\n",

      "\"611\" \"LANDO\" \"Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very  self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny?\"\n",

      "\"636\" \"LUKE\" \"You won't.\"\n",
      "\"637\" \"YODA\" \"Stopped they must be. On this depends. Only a fully trained Jedi  Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.\"\n",
      "\"638\" \"BEN\" \"Patience.\"\n",
      "\"639\" \"LUKE\" \"And sacrifice Han and Leia?\"\n",
      "\"640\" \"YODA\" \"If you honor what they fight for...yes!\"\n",
      "\"641\" \"BEN\" \"If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot  interfere.\"\n",

      "\"645\" \"LUKE\" \"I will. And I'll return. I promise.\"\n",
      "\"646\" \"YODA\" \"Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse.\"\n",

      "\"648\" \"YODA\" \"No. There is another.\"\n",
      "\"649\" \"HAN\" \"The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're  in great shape.\"\n",

      "\"652\" \"LEIA\" \"I don't trust Lando.\"\n",
      "\"653\" \"HAN\" \"Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides,  we'll soon be gone.\"\n",

      "\"655\" \"LEIA\" \"What happened?\"\n",

      "\"667\" \"HAN\" \"No. No problem. Why?\"\n",
      "\"668\" \"LANDO\" \"So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into  the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire.\"\n",
      "\"669\" \"LEIA\" \"So you're part of the mining guild then?\"\n",
      "\"670\" \"LANDO\" \"No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be  noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.\"\n",
      "\"671\" \"HAN\" \"Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this  little operation and shut you down?\"\n",
      "\"672\" \"LANDO\" \"That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over  everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever.\"\n",
